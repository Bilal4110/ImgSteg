### **Introduction**

**ImgSteg** is an opensource steganography tool which encodes and decodes messages within an image. **Please note** this tool should be used for educative purposes only.

### Instructions


1. To install the program either clone the repository (https://github.coventry.ac.uk/5062CEM/CW1-11207724.git) or download the zip file. 


2. To run the program, enter the following command into a terminal of your choice:

   ```Shell
   python3 ImgSteg.py
   ```

3. Once prompted, enter the path of your chosen image file. This will display your image. To exit this image display, press any key or select the exit button present at the top of the window. To ensure that images are efficiently encoded, please only choose .png images.

   ```
   Welcome to ImgSteg.py
   =============================================================
   
   Image Filename with extension (PNG files only): img.png
   ```


3. You will be then be prompted to enter a message. The message you provide will be encoded into the previously supplied image.

   ```
   Welcome to ImgSteg.py
   =============================================================
   
   Image Filename with extension (PNG files only): img.png
   
   Message to encode: This is a test...
   ```
   
   4. Once the program is finished encoding, you will be asked if you wish to decode your previously encoded image. Please input "y" or "n" to confirm your choice.
   
   ```
